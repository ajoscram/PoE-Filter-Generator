PoE Filter Generator is a command-line tool which allows you to modify or create [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) (or PoE, for short) item filters. You feed it a filter with some extra syntax called **rules** put in the filter's comments and it outputs a modified version(s) of that filter tailored by those rules.

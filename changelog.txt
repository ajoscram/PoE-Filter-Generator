To do:
    investigate why standard hardcore is not supported on poe.ninja

    refactor for a Filter class, and have each handler return a list of Filter instead of writing the files themselves
    in that way we can still generate multiple files on a single command and maybe pipe commands in the future

1.0:
    Included the requests library
    Added the Section class
    Added the Rule class
    Added the Generator class
    Added the generate.py script, used to run the program. Calls should look like:
        python generator.py "input_and_output.filter" .strict 3
        python generator.py "input.filter" "output.filter" .chaos
    Added a strictness handler (strictness.py)
    Added a chaos recipe handler (chaos.py)
    Added an economy handler (econ.py)
    Documented every module
    Atomized write operations on the same filter file.
    Added help on generate.py
